## 📘 Overview

This project presents a detailed thermodynamic analysis and optimization of a **cascade refrigeration system** using **ammonia (NH₃)** and **carbon dioxide (CO₂)** as working fluids. The system is designed to efficiently achieve ultra-low temperatures (~−50°C), ideal for critical applications such as **pharmaceutical storage**, **deep freezing**, and **cryogenics**.

The cascade configuration isolates NH₃ to the high-temperature loop for safety while using CO₂ in the distribution side, combining high performance with safer and more environmentally friendly operation.

## 🔧 Objectives

- Analyze performance metrics (COP, compressor work, mass flow rate) for:
  - A simple NH₃ refrigeration cycle
  - A cascade NH₃-CO₂ refrigeration cycle
- Conduct **parametric studies** by varying:
  - Intermediate temperature
  - Condenser temperature
  - Evaporator temperature
  - Degree of supercooling and superheating

---

## 📊 Key Results

- **Baseline Performance:**
  - Simple NH₃ Cycle COP: 1.79
  - Cascade System COP: **1.83** (slightly higher, with reduced compressor work)

- **Parametric Insights:**
  - **Lower intermediate temperatures** improve COP and reduce refrigerant flow rates.
  - **Supercooling NH₃** enhances performance.
  - **Superheating CO₂** decreases performance and increases energy input.
  - System performs better at **higher evaporation temperatures** and **lower condensation temperatures**.
