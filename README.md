# Cascade-Refrigeration

We first simulated a simple NH₃ cycle with an evaporation temperature of -35ºC and a condensation temperature of 50ºC, resulting in a COP of 1.79. Under the same conditions, the **cascade system achieved a COP of 1.829**, showing a measurable improvement.

Through MATLAB-based modeling, we observed that:
- **Lower intermediate temperatures** increase COP and reduce NH₃ mass flow due to its superior thermodynamic properties.
- **Subcooling** improves performance by reducing NH₃ mass flow and increasing COP.
- **Colder ambient temperatures** and **warmer refrigerated spaces** both improve overall efficiency.

Our findings offer insights into designing **efficient**, **eco-friendly**, and **real-world applicable** refrigeration systems.
